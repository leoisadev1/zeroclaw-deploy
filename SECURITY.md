## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report them responsibly:

1. **Email**: Send details to the maintainers via GitHub private vulnerability reporting
2. **GitHub**: Use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/theonlyhennygod/zeroclaw/security/advisories/new)

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix**: Within 2 weeks for critical issues

## Security Architecture

ZeroClaw implements defense-in-depth security:

### Autonomy Levels
- **ReadOnly** — Agent can only read, no shell or write access
- **Supervised** — Agent can act within allowlists (default)
- **Full** — Agent has full access within workspace sandbox

### Sandboxing Layers
1. **Workspace isolation** — All file operations confined to workspace directory
2. **Path traversal blocking** — `..` sequences and absolute paths rejected
3. **Command allowlisting** — Only explicitly approved commands can execute
4. **Forbidden path list** — Critical system paths (`/etc`, `/root`, `~/.ssh`) always blocked
5. **Rate limiting** — Max actions per hour and cost per day caps

### What We Protect Against
- Path traversal attacks (`../../../etc/passwd`)
- Command injection (`rm -rf /`, `curl | sh`)
- Workspace escape via symlinks or absolute paths
- Runaway cost from LLM API calls
- Unauthorized shell command execution

## Security Testing

All security mechanisms are covered by automated tests (129 tests):

```bash
cargo test -- security
cargo test -- tools::shell
cargo test -- tools::file_read
cargo test -- tools::file_write
```
